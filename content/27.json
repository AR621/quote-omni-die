{"author": "Lao Tzu", "quote": "If you look to others for fulfilment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If you happiness depends on money you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have, rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you."}
