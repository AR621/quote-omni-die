  "quote": "Everything in any way beautiful has its beauty by itself, inherent and self-sufficient: praise is no part of it. At any rate, praise does not make anything better or worse. (...) Which of these things derives its beat from praise, or withers under criticism? Does an emerald lose its quality if it is not praised? And what of gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a dagger, a flower, a bush?"
