{"author": "Lao Tzu", "quote": "When people see some things a s beatyful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad. Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. (...) Therefore the master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and he let's them come, things disappear and he let's them go. He has but does not possess, acts but does not expect. When his work is done, he forget's it. That is why it lasts forever."}
